# DRUGS-SIDE-EFFECTS-AND-MEDICAL-CONDITION-ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION

In today's healthcare landscape, data-driven insights are essential for improving patient outcomes and ensuring the safe administration of pharmaceuticals. This project presents a comprehensive 
analysis of drug classes, their associated side effects, pregnancy safety categories, and patient reviews. By consolidating key metrics from various sources, the dashboard provides healthcare 
professionals and stakeholders with actionable insights into the potential risks and benefits of medications.

## Objectives

To empower decision-making by offering a user-friendly interface that enables the exploration of drug interactions, safety concerns, and feedback from real patients. Through interactive 
charts and detailed visualizations, users can filter and examine trends, ultimately supporting better treatment choices and patient care.

## Tools Used

- Power BI: For data visualization.
- Scroller visual to enhance navigation.

## Dataset Description

- Source: Kaggle dataset on drugs, side effects, and medical conditions in the U.S.
- Key Columns: Drug Name, Side Effects, Associated Medical Conditions, Frequency and Severity of Side Effects


## Key Insights

The analysis provides a comprehensive view of drug categories, their corresponding side effects, and medical conditions. Here are some key insights derived from the data:

- Top Drug Categories and Side Effects: Theirs a significant volume of drugs under the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Topical Acne Agents categories, with notable
  side effects associated with both. For instance, SSRIs show a higher prevalence of conditions like anxiety and depression, while topical acne agents are linked to skin-related side effects.

- Medical Conditions by Drug Type: The data highlights that prescription drugs (Rx) cater predominantly to conditions such as anxiety, acne, and weight loss, while over-the-counter (OTC)
  drugs are more associated with mild conditions like insomnia or mild pain management. There is also a significant overlap between certain drugs (Rx and OTC) and pregnancy-related categories,
  indicating potential side effects that need careful consideration, especially for pregnant patients.

- Review Volume and Ratings: Drugs such as Alcohol and Clindamycin have received higher review volumes. Clindamycin, particularly prescribed for bacterial infections, showcases
  a high volume of reviews but has a mixed rating, highlighting potential dissatisfaction or concern from users. The drugs with higher review counts but lower ratings suggest a gap
  in either efficacy or side effect management, necessitating better patient education or drug alternatives.

- Pregnancy-Related Concerns: Drugs categorized under pregnancy categories (A, B, C, etc.) show varying levels of activity and potential risks. This presents an important insight for
  healthcare providers to prioritize monitoring pregnant patients closely when prescribing certain medications.

## Recommendations

1. Patients prescribed with SSRIs and other high-volume prescription drugs should receive targeted education on potential side effects, particularly
   focusing on managing anxiety and depression-related symptoms. Also, educational interventions should also be designed for pregnant patients, providing clearer guidance on the safety of prescription
   and OTC drugs during pregnancy.

2. Healthcare providers should closely monitor drugs with low ratings but high review volumes. This suggests dissatisfaction that could be related to either side effects or lack of effectiveness,
   which may require switching to alternative medications. Regular reviews and follow-ups are recommended to assess the patient's response and to adjust the treatment plan as needed.

3. For drugs like Clindamycin with mixed reviews, consider offering alternative antibiotics that may have fewer side effects or offer better efficacy. In addition, drugs with notable side effects
   but high utilization, such as SSRIs, should be compared with other available treatments to ensure the best therapeutic outcomes.

4. Further research and development should focus on expanding safe drug options for pregnant women, particularly in categories with high side effect profiles. Tailoring medication
   to minimize risk during pregnancy will ensure better maternal and fetal health outcomes.

This project allowed me to gain insights into the intersection of drug usage, side effects, and the medical conditions they are prescribed for. Through careful data analysis and visualization, 
we can identify key areas for healthcare improvement and patient support.

### Pharmaceutical Companies:

- Investigate drugs with frequent adverse effects and explore safer alternatives.
- Consider targeted education campaigns for prescribers and users.

### Policy Makers:

- Promote transparent reporting of side effects.
Mandate regular drug audits based on data trends.


## SCROLLER ACTIVITY:

- The scroller allows users to scroll through the list of different drug classes with ratings per drugs available in the dataset 
- It also allows users to navigate through the extensive list of reported side effects associated with each drug.
